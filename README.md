This is a project I'm doing for my "AI For Games" class at WPI. I'm submitting to \#PROCJAM but the project itself is due the following week, so I will continue to work on it untill a week after its submitted. Here's what I plan to do in the order I plan to do it

## Plan:

Make a procedural medieval map generator. 

1. :white_check_mark:Place castles around the map
2. :white_check_mark:Partition territories off using a Voronoi Diagram
3. Add a terrain generation system (height map or something) and make the territory partitioner take terrain into consideration
4. :white_check_mark:Color the map in to make it look like an old scroll
And if I have time:
5. Make a Markov chain to procedurally generate names of castles and families living in them. 

One major constraint I'd like to have is that a single seed to the RNG produces the same map every time, so maps can be shared using just the seed. A bit of consideration is needed for this to work.:white_check_mark:
